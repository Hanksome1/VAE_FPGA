# VAE on FPGA

In this Project, we aims to implement Variation Encoder on FPGA. This project is decomposed into three parts: 
1. Training on Python
2. Data Transformation
3. Neural Network On FPGA
4. Generate Random Number On FPGA

## Training VAE On Python 
In this part, we use pytorch to train VAE on FPGA, and output all the parameters after the model had finished training. The result is as showned in `vae.png`.
